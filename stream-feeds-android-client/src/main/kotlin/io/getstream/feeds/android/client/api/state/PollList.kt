/**
 * A list of polls that can be queried and paginated.
 *
 * This class provides a way to fetch and manage a collection of polls with support for filtering,
 * sorting, and pagination. It maintains an observable state that can be used in UI components.
 *
 * ## Example Usage:
 * ```kotlin
 * // Create a poll list with a specific query
 * val query = PollsQuery()
 * val pollList = feedsClient.pollList(query)
 *
 * // Fetch initial polls matching the query
 * val polls = pollList.get()
 *
 * // Load more polls if available
 * if (pollList.state.canLoadMore) {
 *    val morePolls = pollList.queryMorePolls()
 * }
 *
 * // Observe state changes
 * pollList.state.polls.collect { polls ->
 *    println("Updated polls: ${polls.size}")
 * }
 * ```
