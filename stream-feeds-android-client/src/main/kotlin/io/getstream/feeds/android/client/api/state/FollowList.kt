 * A class that manages a paginated list of feed members.

 * ```kotlin
 * // Create a follow list with a specific query
 * val query = FollowsQuery()
 * val followList = feedsClient.followList(query)
 *
 * // Fetch initial follows matching the query
 * val follows = followList.get()
 *
 * // Load more follows if available
 * if (followList.state.canLoadMore) {
 *     val moreFollows = followList.queryMoreFollows()
 * }
 *
 * // Observe state changes
 * followList.state.follows.collect { follows ->
 *     println("Updated follows: ${follows.size}")
 * }
