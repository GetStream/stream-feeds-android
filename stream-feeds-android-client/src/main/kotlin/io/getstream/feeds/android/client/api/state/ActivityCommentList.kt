/**
 * A class representing a paginated list of comments for a specific activity.
 *
 * This class provides methods to fetch and manage comments for an activity, including pagination
 * support and real-time updates through WebSocket events. It maintains an observable state that
 * automatically updates when comment-related events are received.
 *
 * ## Example:
 * ```kotlin
 * // Create a comment list for an activity
 * val commentList = feedsClient.activityCommentList(
 *      query = ActivityCommentsQuery(objectId = "activity-123", objectType = "activity")
 * )
 *
 * // Fetch initial comments
 * val comments = commentList.get()
 *
 * // Load more comments if available
 * if (commentList.state.canLoadMore) {
 *     val moreComments = commentList.queryMoreComments()
 * }
 *
 * // Observe state changes
 * commentList.state.comments.collect { comments ->
 *     println("Updated comments: ${comments.size}")
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * ## Features
 * - **Pagination**: Supports loading comments in pages with configurable limits
 * - **Real-time Updates**: Automatically receives WebSocket events for comment changes
 * - **Threaded Comments**: Supports nested comment replies
 * - **Reactions**: Tracks comment reactions and updates in real-time
