/**
 * A query for retrieving follows with filtering, sorting, and pagination options.

 * @property filter Optional filter to apply to the follows query. Use this to narrow down results

 *   supported operators.
 * @property sort Array of sorting criteria to apply to the follows. If not specified, the API will
 *   use its default sorting.
 * @property limit Maximum number of follows to return in a single request. If not specified, the
 *   API will use its default limit.
 * @property next Pagination cursor for fetching the next page of results. This is typically
 *   provided in the response of a previous request.
 * @property previous Pagination cursor for fetching the previous page of results. This is typically
