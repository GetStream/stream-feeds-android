/**
 * A list of poll votes that can be queried and paginated.
 *
 * This class provides a way to fetch and manage a collection of poll votes with support for
 * filtering, sorting, and pagination. It maintains an observable state that can be used in UI
 * components.
 *
 * ## Example Usage:
 * ```kotlin
 * // Create a poll vote list with a specific query
 * val query = PollVotesQuery(pollId = "poll-123")
 * val pollVoteList = feedsClient.pollVoteList(query)
 *
 * // Fetch initial poll votes matching the query
 * val pollVotes = pollVoteList.get()
 *
 * // Load more poll votes if available
 * if (pollVoteList.state.canLoadMore) {
 *    val morePollVotes = pollVoteList.queryMorePollVotes()
 * }
 *
 * // Observe state changes
 * pollVoteList.state.votes.collect { votes ->
 *    println("Updated poll votes: ${votes.size}")
 * }
 * ```
