/**
 * A class representing a paginated list of reactions for a specific comment.
 *
 * This class provides methods to fetch and manage reactions for a comment, including
 * pagination support and real-time updates through WebSocket events. It maintains an
 * observable state that automatically updates when reaction-related events are received.
 *
 * ## Example:
 * ```kotlin
 * // Create a reaction list for a comment
 * val query = CommentReactionsQuery(commentId = "comment-123")
 * val reactionList = feedsClient.commentReactionList(query)
 *
 * // Fetch initial reactions
 * val reactions = reactionList.get()
 *
 * // Load more reactions if available
 * if (reactionList.state.canLoadMore) {
 *     val moreReactions = reactionList.queryMoreReactions()
 * }
 *
 * // Observe state changes
 * reactionList.state.reactions.collect { reactions ->
 *     Log.d(TAG, "Updated reactions: ${reactions.size}")
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * ## Features
 *
 * - **Pagination**: Supports loading reactions in pages with configurable limits
 * - **Real-time Updates**: Automatically receives WebSocket events for reaction changes
 * - **Filtering**: Supports filtering by reaction type, user ID, and creation date
 * - **Sorting**: Configurable sorting options for reaction ordering
 * - **Observable State**: Provides reactive state management for UI updates
