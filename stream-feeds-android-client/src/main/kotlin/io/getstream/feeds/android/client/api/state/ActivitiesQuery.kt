/**
 * A query for retrieving activities with filtering, sorting, and pagination options.
 *
 * Use this model to configure how activities should be fetched from the Stream Feeds API.
 * You can specify filters to narrow down results, sorting options, and pagination parameters.
 *
 * Example usage:
 * ```kotlin
 * val query = ActivitiesQuery(
 *   filter = Filter.eq("id", "activity-id-1"),
 *   sort = listOf(ActivitiesSort(ActivitiesSortField.CreatedAt, SortDirection.REVERSE)),
 *   limit = 20,
 * )
 *
 * @property filter Optional filter to apply to the activities query. Use this to narrow down
 * results based on specific criteria.
 * @property sort Array of sorting criteria to apply to the activities. If not specified, the API
 * will use its default sorting.
 * @property next Pagination cursor for fetching the next page of results. This is typically
 * provided in the response of a previous request.
 * @property previous Pagination cursor for fetching the previous page of results. This is typically
 * provided in the response of a previous request.
 * @property limit Maximum number of activities to return in a single request. If not specified,
 * the API will use its default limit.
