/**
 * A query configuration for fetching comments for a specific activity.
 *
 * This class defines the parameters used to fetch comments for an activity,
 * including pagination settings, sorting options, and depth configuration for
 * threaded comments.
 *
 * ## Features
 *
 * - **Pagination**: Supports `next` and `previous` cursors for efficient pagination
 * - **Sorting**: Configurable sorting options for comment ordering
 * - **Depth Control**: Limits the depth of threaded comment replies
 * - **Reply Limits**: Controls the number of replies to fetch per comment
 *
 * @property objectId The unique identifier of the activity to fetch comments for.
 * @property objectType The type of object (typically "activity" for activity comments).
 * @property depth The maximum depth of threaded comments to fetch.
 * This parameter controls how many levels of nested replies to include.
 * For example, a depth of 2 will include comments and their direct replies,
 * but not replies to replies.
 * - `null`: No depth limit (fetch all levels)
 * - `1`: Only top-level comments
 * - `2`: Comments and their direct replies
 * - `3`: Comments, replies, and replies to replies
 * @property limit The maximum number of comments to fetch per request.
 * This parameter controls the page size for pagination. Larger values
 * reduce the number of API calls needed but may increase response time.
 * - `null`: Use server default (typically 25)
 * - `10-50`: Recommended range for most use cases
 * - `>50`: May impact performance
 * @property next The pagination cursor for fetching the next page of comments.
 * This cursor is provided by the server in the pagination response and
 * should be used to fetch the next page of results.
 * @property previous The pagination cursor for fetching the previous page of comments.
 * This cursor is provided by the server in the pagination response and
 * should be used to fetch the previous page of results.
 * @property repliesLimit The maximum number of replies to fetch per comment.
 * This parameter controls how many replies are included for each comment
 * in the response. It's useful for limiting the size of threaded comments.
 * - `null`: Fetch all replies (subject to depth limit)
 * - `5-10`: Recommended for most use cases
 * - `>20`: May impact performance
 * @property sort The sorting criteria for comments.
