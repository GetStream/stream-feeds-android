/**
 * An observable state object that manages the current state of a comment list.
 *
 * This interface maintains the current list of comments, pagination information, and provides
 * real-time updates. It automatically handles WebSocket events to keep the comment list
 * synchronized.
 *
 * ## Features
 * - **Observable State**: Uses flow properties for reactive UI updates
 * - **Real-time Updates**: Automatically receives WebSocket events for comment changes
 * - **Pagination Support**: Tracks pagination state for loading more comments
 * - **Change Handlers**: Internal handlers for processing WebSocket events
