/**
 * A list of activity reactions that provides pagination, filtering, and real-time updates.
 *
 * This class manages a collection of reactions for a specific activity. It provides methods
 * to fetch reactions with pagination support and automatically handles real-time updates
 * when reactions are added or removed from the activity.
 *
 * ## Example:
 * ```kotlin
 * val query = ActivityReactionsQuery(activityId = "activity-123")
 * val reactionList = feedsClient.activityReactionList(query)
 *
 * // Fetch initial reactions
 * val reactions = reactionList.get()
 *
 * // Load more reactions if available
 * if (reactionList.state.canLoadMore) {
 *     val moreReactions = reactionList.queryMoreReactions()
 * }
 *
 * // Observe state changes
 * reactionList.state.reactions.collect { reactions ->
 *     println("Updated reactions: ${reactions.size}")
 * }
 * ```
