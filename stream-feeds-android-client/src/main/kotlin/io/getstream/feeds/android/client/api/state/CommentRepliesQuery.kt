/**
 * A query configuration for fetching replies to a specific comment.
 *
 * This class defines the parameters used to fetch replies to a comment,
 * including pagination settings, sorting options, and depth configuration for
 * nested reply structures.
 *
 * ## Features
 *
 * - **Pagination**: Supports `next` and `previous` cursors for efficient pagination
 * - **Sorting**: Configurable sorting options for reply ordering
 * - **Depth Control**: Limits the depth of nested reply structures
 * - **Reply Limits**: Controls the number of nested replies to fetch per reply
 *
 * @property commentId The unique identifier of the comment to fetch replies for.
 * @property depth The maximum depth of nested replies to fetch.
 * This parameter controls how many levels of nested replies to include.
 * For example, a depth of 2 will include replies and their direct replies,
 * but not replies to replies to replies.
 * - `null`: No depth limit (fetch all levels)
 * - `1`: Only top-level comments
 * - `2`: Comments and their direct replies
 * - `3`: Comments, replies, and replies to replies
 * @property limit The maximum number of replies to fetch per request. This parameter controls the
 * page size for pagination. Larger values reduce the number of API calls needed but may increase
 * response time.
 * - `null`: Use server default
 * @property next The pagination cursor for fetching the next page of replies. This cursor is
 * provided by the server in the pagination response and should be used to fetch the next page of
 * results.
 * @property previous The pagination cursor for fetching the previous page of replies. This cursor
 * is provided by the server in the pagination response and should be used to fetch the previous
 * page of results.
 * @property repliesLimit The maximum number of nested replies to fetch per reply. This parameter
 * controls how many nested replies are included for each reply in the response. It's useful for
 * limiting the size of deeply threaded reply structures.
 * @property sort The sorting criteria for replies.
