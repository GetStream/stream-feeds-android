/**
 * An observable object representing the current state of an activity's comment list.
 *
 * This class manages the state of comments for a specific activity, including the list of comments,
 * pagination information, and real-time updates from WebSocket events. It automatically handles
 * comment additions, updates, deletions, and reaction changes.
 *
 * ## Example:
 * ```kotlin
 * // Access the state from an ActivityCommentList
 * val commentList = feedsClient.activityCommentList(query)
 * val state = commentList.state
 *
 * // Observe comment changes
 * state.comments.collect { comments ->
 *     // Update UI with new comments
 * }
 *
 * // Check pagination status
 * if (state.canLoadMore) {
 *     // Load more comments
 * }
 *
 * // Access current comments
 * val currentComments = state.comments.value
 * ```
 *
 * ## Features
 * - **Observable State**: Uses flow properties for reactive UI updates
 * - **Real-time Updates**: Automatically receives WebSocket events for comment changes
 * - **Pagination Support**: Tracks pagination state for loading more comments
 * - **Change Handlers**: Internal handlers for processing WebSocket events
