/**
 * An observable object representing the current state of a comment's reply list.
 *
 * This class manages the state of replies for a specific comment, including the list of replies,
 * pagination information, and real-time updates from WebSocket events. It automatically handles
 * reply updates and reaction changes.
 *
 * ## Features
 * - **Observable State**: Uses `@Published` properties for reactive UI updates
 * - **Real-time Updates**: Automatically receives WebSocket events for reply changes
 * - **Pagination Support**: Tracks pagination state for loading more replies
 * - **Change Handlers**: Internal handlers for processing WebSocket events
