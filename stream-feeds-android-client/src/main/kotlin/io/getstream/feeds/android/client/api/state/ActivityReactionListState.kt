/**
 * An observable state object that manages the current state of an activity reaction list.
 *
 * This class provides reactive state management for a collection of activity reactions. It
 * automatically handles real-time updates when reactions are added or removed from the activity,
 * and maintains pagination state for loading additional reactions.
 *
 * ## Example:
 * ```kotlin
 * // Access the state from an ActivityReactionList
 * val reactionList = feedsClient.activityReactionList(query)
 * val state = reactionList.state
 *
 * // Observe reaction changes
 * state.reactions.collect { reactions ->
 *    // Update UI with new reactions
 * }
 *
 * // Check pagination status
 * if (state.canLoadMore) {
 *    // Load more reactions
 * }
 *
 * // Access current reactions
 * val currentReactions = state.reactions.value
 * ```
