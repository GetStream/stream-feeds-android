This is the official Android SDK for Stream Feeds, a platform for building apps with activity feeds support. The
repository includes a low-level SDK that communicates with Stream's backend, as well as a demo app that showcases how to
use it.

For detailed examples and supported features, please check out
our [docs](https://getstream.io/activity-feeds/docs/android/).

Note: Activity Feeds V3 is in closed alpha ‚Äî do not use it in production (just yet).

## What is Stream?

Stream allows developers to rapidly deploy scalable feeds, chat messaging and video with an industry leading 99.999%
uptime SLA guarantee.

Stream lets you build **activity feeds at scale**. The largest apps on Stream have over **100 M+ users**.
V3 keeps that scalability while giving you more flexibility over the content shown in your feed.

## What‚Äôs new in Feeds V3

- **For-You feed**: Most modern apps combine a ‚ÄúFor You‚Äù feed with a regular ‚ÄúFollowing‚Äù feed. V3 introduces **activity
  selectors** so you can:
    - surface popular activities
    - show activities near the user
    - match activities to a user‚Äôs interests
    - mix-and-match these selectors to build an engaging personalized feed.

- **Performance**: 20‚Äì30% faster flat feeds. Major speedups for aggregation & ranking (full benchmarks coming soon)

- **Client-side SDKs**

- **Activity filtering**: Filter activity feeds with almost no hit to performance

- **Comments**: Voting, ranking, threading, images, URL previews, @mentions & notifications. Basically all the features
  of Reddit style commenting systems.

- **Advanced feed features**:
    - Activity expiration
    - Visibility controls
    - Feed visibility levels
    - Feed members
    - Bookmarking
    - Follow-approval flow
    - Stories support

- **Search & queries**: Activity search, **query activities**, and **query feeds** endpoints.

- **Modern essentials**:
    - Permissions
    - OpenAPI spec
    - GDPR endpoints
    - Realtime WebSocket events
    - Push notifications
    - ‚ÄúOwn capabilities‚Äù API.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Installation

The Android SDK can be added to your project with Gradle. If you are starting a new project, we always recommend using
the latest release. Releases and changes are published on the
[GitHub releases page](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-feeds-android/releases).

To add the SDK, open your `build.gradle` or `build.gradle.kts` file and add:

```kotlin
dependencies {
    implementation("io.getstream:stream-feeds-android-client:<latest-version>")
}
```
### Basic Usage

To get started, you need to create a `FeedsClient` with your API key and a token provider.

Afterwards, it's pretty straightforward to start adding feeds and activities.

Check our docs for more details.

```kotlin
// Initialize the client
val client = FeedsClient(
    apiKey = StreamApiKey.fromString("<your_api_key>"),
    user = User(id = "john"),
    context = context,
    tokenProvider = object : StreamTokenProvider {
        override suspend fun loadToken(userId: StreamUserId): StreamToken {
            return StreamToken.fromString("<user_token>")
        }
    }
)

// Create a feed (or get its data if it exists)
val feed = client.feed(group = "user", id = "john")
feed.getOrCreate()

// Add activity
val activity = feed.addActivity(
    request = FeedAddActivityRequest(
        text = "Hello, Stream Feeds!",
        type = "post"
    )
)
```

## üìñ Key Concepts

### Activities

Activities are the core content units in Stream Feeds. They can represent posts, photos, videos, polls, and any custom
content type you define.

### Feeds

Feeds are collections of activities. They can be personal feeds, timeline feeds, notification feeds, or custom feeds for
your specific use case.

### Real-time Updates

Stream Feeds provides real-time updates through WebSocket connections, ensuring your app stays synchronized with the
latest content.

### Social Features

Built-in support for reactions, comments, bookmarks, and polls makes it easy to build engaging social experiences.

## üë©‚Äçüíª¬†Free for Makers¬†üë®‚Äçüíª

Stream is free for most side and hobby projects. To qualify, your project/company needs to have < 5 team members
and < $10k in monthly revenue. Makers get $100 in monthly credit for video for free.
